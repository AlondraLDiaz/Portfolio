    <H1> <strong> Pantry </strong></H1>
    <p class="pantry">Pantry is a food guide app that helps people easily explore food recipes
        and local cuisines to ease the choice in planning a meal or deciding where and what to eat.
        Pantry was created to help plan meals ahead of time so that one is able to save money and
        time while providing a healthy meal to serve any family size.</p>

        <H4>Problem</H4>
        <p class="details">
            We believe that there is a universal struggle for people to decide what to cook for dinner or if they should
            eat out
            instead. Many donâ€™t have a plan or the time to figure out what to cook that night. </p>

        <H4>Solution</H4>
        <p class="details">
            We believe Pantry, a meal planning app for people who are too busy or have trouble figuring out what to eat,
            will help
            our users create meal plans that fit their schedule so they can achieve a more productive meal time without
            having to
            worry about what to cook.</p>

            <H2> <strong> Research </strong></H2>
            <br>

            <p class="researchContent"> We wanted to understand what were the challenges when it comes to feeding a
                family. We all had our
                experiences as to why it could be difficult for our own lives but we kept several questions in mind
                as we conducted our research by conducting interviews with family households. Through our research
                we wanted to identify most users current meal planning habits. Understand users typical food
                preferences and tastes. Discover user pain points of feeding a family on a weekly basis.</p>
        </div>

  <!-- Problem Statment Section  -->

        <div class="contentDefSynth">
            <H2> <strong> Definition & Syntheis </strong></H2>
            <br>

            <p class="defsynthContent"> As we defined our problem through our survey we were ready to further develop
                our questions for our interviews based on our survey results. We synthesized the data from our survey
                and interviews to help use start identfying how we can resolve the challenges facing our users goal's
                when it comes to meal planning. We deduced from our data the solutions needed for an app and began
                ideating a design that is friendly, organized, and fun for our users to spend time, money and energy out
                of meal planning onto their plates.

          <!-- Iteration Section -->
        <div class="contentIdeation">
            <H2> <strong> Ideation </strong></H2>
            <br>

            <p class="ideationContent"> We ideated using an Affinity Diagram and Feature Priotization Matrix. These
                highlighted what we could feasibly include in our app while also providing a resolution to the user.
                As we gathered our top features, we began sketching our wireframes and created a low-fidelity protoype.

            <H2> <strong> Low Fidelity </strong></H2>
            <br>

            <p class="lowfiprotoContent">
                To test the functionality of our app, we conducted usablity testing early into our protoype to ensure we
                could refine our app and iterate our final prototype to be functional and intutive to our users.
        </div>


        <div class="usertest">
            <H2> <strong> User Testing & Outcomes </strong></H2>
            <br>

            <p class="usertestingContent">
                We iterated our prototye three times due to the feedback we recieved. It was vital to ensure our app was
                friendly
                and functional due to the complexitity of our problem. Our solution had to have a clear task flow which
                was refined
                in our second iteration and add a minimalistic design. Our final usuability testing phase reception was
                considered
                great among our users testing and provided additional recommendations to grow Pantry.
