 <!--  Introduction -->

<div class="pantryOverview">
    <H1> <strong> Utah Open Lands </strong></H1>
    <p class="pantry"> Utah Open Lands is a non-profit organization that protects Utah land in its natural state and
        prevents any alterations or destruction or construction on the land. Redesigning Utah Open Lands is meant to help
        captivate and capture new audiences to the cause to engage, participate or donate to maintain the mission of keeping
        Utah land open to everyone.</p>

        <H4>Problem</H4>
        <p class="details">
            Utah Open Lands users want to easily find information about the nonprofit and
            donation opportunities. They also feel it is important to know how
            donations are being used in the organization.
            
        <H4>Solution</H4>
        <p class="details">
            We believe that adding more content regarding donations, videos and other images from social events and volunteer projects throughout the website will engage current users. Along with updating the color guide, navigation UI/IA + functionality, and creating consistent buttons displayed to captivate new audiences. By adding these elements we can enable people to discover Utah Open Lands by bringing
            a more modern and informative experience to the UOL website overall.

 <!--  Research Section -->

     <div class="contentResearch">
            <H2> <strong> Research </strong></H2>

            <h5>Objectives</h5>

            <p class="researchContent"> We began our research with investigating what is and isn’t motivating users to continue
                through the Utah Open Lands (UOL) website to volunteer or donate. We sought to discover the components to what
                captivates a user to seek UOL and either volunteer/donate. This probing helped us narrow our research objectives to
                the following:
            <ul class="research-lists">
                <li>Identify design elements that psychological impact user decisions</li>
                <li>Discover how the content helps the user become informed, provide information,<br> and feel engaged</li>
                <li>Discover how navigation content and infrastructure provide user with tools <br> to search for user needs</li>
            </ul></p>
            <br>
            <p class="researchContent">
                Thus, we wanted to get an understanding of who UOL and users are, so we contancted the stakeholders to conduct an interview to gain insights for our research. 
            </p>


            <h5>Stakeholder Interview</h5>
            
            <p class="researchContent">
                We conducted stakeholder interviews remotely via Zoom in which we had prepared several open-ended questions to be able
                to capture an in-depth understanding of who UOL was, their users and how they connect. We described our goal to the
                stakeholders about redesigning their website for the purpose of garnishing more audiences and ease any current user
                experience with responsiveness and UI updates. Our interview provided details about UOL users by the logistics and
                financial sectors of their organization.
                <br><br>
                They are very informed about their users being conveyed in two distinct groups which are landowners and a demographic of
                45 years old +. They also distinguished their volunteers from donors being that volunteer demographics are 40 years old
                and younger. To be portrayed as realistic as possible, the stakeholders recommended we keep the logo and color style
                consistently the same as their current guide along with documents kept on site, otherwise we could update the rest of
                the site.
                <br><br>
                With the insights from our interview, we were ready to conduct research on competitors.
            </p>


                <h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
            
                <p class="researchContent">
                    We started reviewing educational sites and product sites then evaluating their presentation of information. We
                    conducted a IA heuristic of these sites due to the ample amount of information there is on artificial grass and
                    complexity of presentation along with other features. Our analysis provided us with how we can present and provide
                    our users ease in accessing information and implementing an informed choice laid out on one website.</p>
                    <img src="Utah Open Lands Images/Utah Open Lands - Competitor Analysis copy.jpeg" style="width: 990px; margin-left: 15%;margin-top: 3%;margin-bottom: 3%;">

                    <h5>Proto Persona</h5>

                    <p class="researchContent">
                        Now that we had an understanding of UOL, we wanted to focus on centering around a user. Therefore we used a survey questionnaire to inform us on how we create our proto persona.  This provided us insight as to why and how our users seek out UOL along with their gains and pain points.</p>
                    <img src="Utah Open Lands Images/Utah Open Lands - Proto Persona copy.jpeg" style="width: 850px; margin-left: 21.5%;margin-top: 5%;">

<h5>User Interviews</h5>
<p class="researchContent">
    With a user in mind, we started our research interview plan with questions developing on each objective. We
    recruited five participants to interview to gain an in-depth understanding of our users and confirm our initial
    comprehension of them from our survey and proto persona. We discovered gains and pain points from our interviews and
    quoted in the following:
<ul class="research-lists">
    <li><em>“The give tab is very overwhelming, too many
            options and not enough description about what it is.” </em>
    </li><br>
    <li><em>“It seems like they put a lot of effort into trying to get donations
            without spending the time to convince me what my donation will do
            and why I should donate.”
        </em> </li><br>
    <li><em>“Understanding more about the website, what their contributions throughout
            the years have already helped them achieve. What their future goals
            are would motivate me more to donate or volunteer.”
        </em> </li><br>
    <li><em>“The pages have the title, but other than that it is kind of confusing to find where you are.
            There aren’t any breadcrumbs to know where you are.”
        </em> </li>
</ul>

            <p class="defsynthContent">We synthesized the data from our survey and interviews to help us start identifying how we can resolve the challenges facing our users goal's when it comes to volunteering and/or donating to UOL.</p>

            <h5>Affinity Diagram</h5>

            <p class="defsynthContent">
                We gathered and organized by our insights from our interviews and used an Affinity Diagram to organize our insights.
                These included their demographics and snippets of comments from our interviews. We scoped for common patterns
                between our users and conducted further dissection of notes and sorted them into groups.</p>

            <p class="defsynthContent">
                Utah’s Open Lands is updating their website to help potential donors and volunteers easily find the services they are looking for.

            <h5>Empathy Map</h5>
            <p class="defsynthContent">
                After grouping our insights we wanted to gain a deeper understanding of how our user’s empathize with their time and
                money spent with UOL. We used an empathy map to distinguish our user’s various modes of perception and how they can
                connect with UOL.
                </p>
            <img src="Utah Open Lands Images/Utah Open Lands - Empathy Map copy.jpeg"style="width: 800px; margin-left: 24%;margin-top: 3%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
            <p class="defsynthContent">
                From our deduced data, we discovered the needs for our site to address both pains and gains expressed from our user.
                However, we desired to stay centered on our specific user so we began with composing a user persona.
            </p>
            <br>
           <h5>User Persona</h5>
           <p class="defsynthContent">
            Using our knowledge from our affinity map, value proposition and empathy map we created a user persona. Hello to Savannah Peterson!

        <p class="defsynthContent">
       Now with a better understanding with who our UOL user is, their pains and gains. We began sketching our wireframes.

    <h5>Lo-fi Wireframe Sketches</h5>
    <p class="defsynthContent">
    Our wireframes focused on the main pages our users would interact with.

<h5>Task Flow</h5>
<p class="defsynthContent">
    In order to understand the journey of our users, we needed to see the steps they would take while interacting with
    the site. It was straightforward yet differs on how they both will introduce and interact with the different tasks.

    style="width: 800px; margin-left: 24%;margin-top: 3%; margin-bottom: 0%;">


<h5>Card Sorting</h5>
<p class="defsynthContent">
    We started planning the architecture of the site with sorting cards and organizing the navigation in a way that
    would be intuitive for the users.
</p>

    style="width: 800px; margin-left: 23%;margin-top: 3%; margin-bottom: 0%;">

<h5>Sitemap</h5>
<p class="defsynthContent">
    We finalized our card sorting, after we brainstormed how our user would logically search for information and based
    on our interviews the top pains that were expressed and searched for which are “what they do” and “who they are”. We
    restructured the architecture to prioritize these seeked pages on the site and what would follow logically.

            <p class="protoContent">
                To test the functionality of our app, we conducted usablity testing early into our protoype to ensure we
                could refine our app and iterate our final prototype to be functional and intutive to our users.

            <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
            <p class="protoContent">
                Our usability testing was done remote via Zoom using A/B testing on the navigation components. We wanted to test if the
                navigation architecture was initially understood to be logical for our users based on interview insights. We recruited
                five participants to test our design’s functionality and navigation by stating having them complete different tasks. We
                formulated tasks to navigate top pain points which are donating, who they are, what they do.
                We set up two different prototypes with different IA to see which would be the most successful with our users. The
                results concluded the following:
                <ul class="research-lists">
                    <li>test B was preferred over test A</li>
                    <li>test A was more successful amongst the group</li>
                    <li>Donation UI/IA  impacted how likely user would give donation </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="protoContent">
                    We asked our interviews to provide any feedback that could be improved upon with the Think Aloud method during tasks. The following feedback we received was to: 
                    <ul class="research-lists">
                    <li>Move Give tab</li>
                    <li>Create consistent secondary navigation</li>
                        <li>Make clickable elements obvious</li>
                            <li>Make design elements flow throughout the prototype</li>
                                <li>Add compelling imagery</li>
                                    <li>Remove pop-up from donate page</li>
                                        <li>Make fonts a little bigger</li>
                                            <li>Make headers consistent</li>

            <H2> <strong> Branding</strong></H2>
            <p class="protoContent">
                Before applying UI design to our wireframes, we wanted to ensure that the site was consistent. We had begun with drawing from similar colors of the logo and nature as the brand.
        </p>

        <h5>Mood Board</h5>
        <p class="protoContent">
            We began seeking inspiration via Google search images and Pinterest. We searched minimal and modern along with nature and neutral colors to complement the existing UI elements that were being kept for UOL. This helped us find the modern element we wanted to incorporate into the style and guide the design.

                We learned a lot about land conservation and the significance of how people become involved in the mission whether
                as volunteers or donors. Ownership rights are vital to the participants as much as it is the community and having an
                organization assist in these conversations is like being the translator to a complex topic. We gained better insight
                on how to convey ample information in a digestible way that enables a delightful experience for the users, returning
                or new.
                <br> <br>
                As we expand on our future opportunities to develop, we will need to focus on content writing, different media
                formatting and presenting a fully developed project.
