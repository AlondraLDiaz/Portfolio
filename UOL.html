 <!--  Introduction -->

<div class="pantryOverview">
    <H1> <strong> Utah Open Lands </strong></H1>
    <p class="pantry"> Utah Open Lands is a non-profit organization that protects Utah land in its natural state and
        prevents any alterations or destruction or construction on the land. Redesigning Utah Open Lands is meant to help
        captivate and capture new audiences to the cause to engage, participate or donate to maintain the mission of keeping
        Utah land open to everyone.</p>

        <H4>Problem</H4>
        <p class="details">
            Utah Open Lands users want to easily find information about the nonprofit and
            donation opportunities. They also feel it is important to know how
            donations are being used in the organization.
            
        <H4>Solution</H4>
        <p class="details">
            We believe that adding more content regarding donations, videos and other images from social events and volunteer projects throughout the website will engage current users. Along with updating the color guide, navigation UI/IA + functionality, and creating consistent buttons displayed to captivate new audiences. By adding these elements we can enable people to discover Utah Open Lands by bringing
            a more modern and informative experience to the UOL website overall.

 <!--  Research Section -->

     <div class="contentResearch">
            <H2> <strong> Research </strong></H2>

            <h5>Objectives</h5>

            <p class="researchContent"> We began our research with investigating what is and isn’t motivating users to continue
                through the Utah Open Lands (UOL) website to volunteer or donate. We sought to discover the components to what
                captivates a user to seek UOL and either volunteer/donate. This probing helped us narrow our research objectives to
                the following:
            <ul class="research-lists">
                <ol>Identify design elements that psychological impact user decisions</ol>
                <ol>Discover how the content helps the user become informed, provide information, and feel engaged</ol>
                <ol>Discover how navigation content and infrastructure provide user with tools to search for user needs</ol>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p class="researchContent">
                Thus, we started our research on our competitor’s to discover what knowledge is already available and how we can
                develop our site. </ol>
            </p>

                <h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
            
                <p class="researchContent">
                    We started reviewing educational sites and product sites then evaluating their presentation of information. We
                    conducted a IA heuristic of these sites due to the ample amount of information there is on artificial grass and
                    complexity of presentation along with other features. Our analysis provided us with how we can present and provide
                    our users ease in accessing information and implementing an informed choice laid out on one website.</p>
                    <img src="Utah Open Lands Images/Utah Open Lands - Competitor Analysis copy.jpeg" style="width: 800px; margin-left: 20%;margin-top: 3%;margin-bottom: 3%;">

                    <h5>Proto Persona</h5>

                    <p class="researchContent">
                    After our insight with our research, we needed to preview who Kill Your Grass users would be. We began with sending a
                    survey questionnaire with demographics and general questions about artificial grass and lawn care. The survey results
                    provided us insight on what we needed to start composing our proto persona. This enabled us to understand our users'
                    needs based on their gains and pain points but most importantly why and how our users would seek our site.
                    <img src="Utah Open Lands Images/Utah Open Lands - Proto Persona copy.jpeg" style="width: 800px; margin-left: 15.5%;margin-top: 5%;">


                    <h5>User Interviews</h5>
                    <p class="researchContent">
                        With a user in mind, we started our research interview plan with questions developing on each objective. The
                        preliminary survey allowed us to see how our questions can differ and gain a deeper insight to the psychology of our users using
                        open-ended questions while giving us a criteria for who our ideal interviewees are. We recruited five participants to
                        interview to gain an in-depth understanding of our users and confirm our initial comprehension of them from our
                        survey and proto persona. We discover overarching themes which are the following:
                        <ul class="lists">
                        <ol>Most users have some knowledge of Artificial grass</ol>
                        <ol>Most users care for yard about 1x a week ( watering varied)</ol>
                        <ol>3:5 said they would get artificial grass</ol>
                        <ol>Time is a common issue</ol>
                        <ol>Cost is the only hesitation about artificial grass</ol>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
    </div>

  <!-- Define & Ideate  -->

        <div class="contentDefSynth">
            <H2> <strong> Define & Ideate </strong></H2>
            <p class="defsynthContent"> We synthesized the data from our survey and interviews to help us start identifying how we
                can resolve the challenges facing our users goal's when it comes to alleviating lawn care expenditures, time and
                energy.</p>

            <h5>Affinity Diagram</h5>

            <p class="defsynthContent">
                We gathered and organized by our insights from our interviews and used an Affinity Diagram to organize our insights.
                These included their demographics and snippets of comments from our interviews. We scoped for common patterns
                between our users and conducted further dissection of notes and sorted them into groups.</p>
            <img src="Utah Open Lands Images/Utah Open Lands - Affinity Diagram copy.jpeg" style="width: 950px; margin-left: 20%;margin-top: 3%;">
           
            <h5>Empathy Map</h5>
            <p class="defsynthContent">
                After grouping our insights we wanted to gain a deeper understanding of how our user’s empathize with their yard. We
                used an empathy map to distinguish our user’s modes of perception and how they could connect to artificial grass.
            </p>
            <img src="Utah Open Lands Images/Utah Open Lands - Empathy Map copy.jpeg"style="width: 800px; margin-left: 24%;margin-top: 3%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
            <p class="defsynthContent">
                From our deduced data, we discovered the needs for our site to address both pains and gains expressed from our user.
                However, we desired to stay centered on our specific user so we began with composing a user persona.
            </p>
            <br>
           <h5>User Persona</h5>
           <p class="defsynthContent">
            With the insight from our empathy map and affinity diagram, We wanted to ensure we had a focal user as we began to ideate and know who to design for. We created our user persona Ray Jensen. 
        </p>
        <img src="Utah Open Lands Images/User PERSONA copy.png"style="width: 700px; margin-left: 24%;margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 8%;">
        <p class="defsynthContent">
        Now with a better understanding with who our Kill Your Grass user is, their pains and gains. We 
        gathered our top features and began sketching our wireframes.
    </p>

    <h5>Lo-fi Wireframe Sketches</h5>
    <p class="defsynthContent">
    Our wireframes focused on the main pages our users would interact with.

            <p class="protoContent">
                To test the functionality of our app, we conducted usablity testing early into our protoype to ensure we
                could refine our app and iterate our final prototype to be functional and intutive to our users.
            </p>
                
            <h5>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h5>
            <p class="protoContent"> Starting our prototype began with creating our wireframes using Adobe XD.</p>

            <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
            <p class="protoContent">
                Our usability testing was done remote via Zoom with a moderated Think Aloud method. We recruited five participants
                to test our design’s functionality by stating their thoughts on how they felt, what they saw, and their actions
                while going testing the site by completing tasks given. We formulated tasks based on our main pages which were our
                homepage, resources, gallery and education page. The following feedback we received was to: 
                <ul class="lists">
                    <ol>Reduce text and add more white space</ol>
                    <ol>Add a transition or animation to indicate more content on homepage</ol>
                    <ol>Change layout of education pages</ol>
                    <ol>Time is a common issue</ol>
                    <ol>Eliminate sticky navigation</ol>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h5>Revisions</h5>
            <p class="protoContent">
                We reiterated on our site twice due to functionality on the development front, along with ensuring fluidity of content to the user flow. 
                We added and adjusted the following:
                <ul class="lists">
                    <ol>Adjust FAQs from cards</ol>
                    <ol>Reformatt Resource Cards</ol>
                    <ol> Create Nav with dropdown</ol>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <H2> <strong> Branding</strong></H2>
            <p class="protoContent">
            Before applying UI design to our wireframes, we wanted to ensure that the site had a motif. We had begun with the inspiration of calling our site Kill Your Grass but contemplating the tone that could accompany our brand name.
        </p>

        <h5>Mood Board</h5>
        <p class="protoContent">
            We began seeking inspiration via Google search images and Pinterest. We searched for cutting grass images and mowing the lawn. It is when we stumbled upon our mascot, Rock N’ Roll guy mowing the lawn. This provided us the tone we wanted Kill Your Grass to carry: Edgy, Fresh, Rocking, Eclectic. 
        </p>

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h5>Logo Design</h5>
    <p class="protoContent">
    Now we wanted the Logo to convey the same tone as our brand and content. We knew we wanted to use a dense font typeface and convey the edge of a cut. We had incorporated these ideas into our elements in the first and second design. However, based on peer feedback we needed to change the way we incorporated our methods to be cleaner and subtle. We decided to change the color to bring the subtle grass in the background and maintain our idea. Along with finding a font that had a dense and edgy element of lines within the letters.

            <p class="protoContent">
                After designing our logo and solidifying elements of the Kill your grass brand. We created our  style guide with the intention to complement our key UI elements. Then we applied our style guide to our wireframes.

            <h1><strong> Outcome &
            <br>Opportunities</strong></h1>
            <p class="outcomeContent">
                This was our last group project with my team and we all agreed to have fun with our topic choice for the site. As we
                were brainstorming topics, we drifted to the discussion about the dilemma of drought conditions and lawn care. I had
                heard about a movement of people intentionally letting their lawns die so they can conserve water but as defiance to
                strict neighborhood HOA. We landed on taking this idea and spinning it to promote artificial grass. We learned a lot
                about artificial grass and gained better insight from those with lawns on how to approach promoting artificial grass
                with balancing a product and providing education.
                <br><br>
                As my team built upon our knowledge of development, we learned that translating design principles to developer practical
                application is inherently more complex. It requires more than just communicating but to be able to understand the
                capabilities of software and have a vast knowledge of how to speak in programming languages. As we expand on our future
                opportunities to develop, we will need to focus on development, content writing and practical technical implementation
                for the feasibility to have these features added to Kill Your Grass.
