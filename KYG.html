        <p class="details">
         We believe that there is  a common denominator when lawn care is discussed. Many want to save time working in the yard so that they can do the things they enjoy. Often money has a huge impact when it comes to maintenance. Many don’t know the alternative lawn options. </p>

        <H4>Solution</H4>
        <p class="details">
         Kill Your Grass provides people holistic information on artificial grass in order to make an informed decision about replacing grass/sod with artificial grass. This knowledge details the benefits of artificial grass on the environment, on financial expenditures and time preservation while being accessible to everyone.</p>

 <!--  Research Section -->

     <div class="contentResearch">
            <H2> <strong> Research </strong></H2>

            <h5>Objectives</h5>

            <p class="researchContent"> Our research began when we probed ourselves for why artificial grass could be significant
                and how our users could find this information. We sought to know what motivated people to install artificial grass
                but what information would our users need to know to even seek out artificial grass. This helped us to narrow our
                research objectives to the following:
                <ul>
                <ol>Identify that we need to discover our users' knowledge of artificial grass.</ol>
                <ol>Identify users' challenges or barriers to have artificial grass as their lawn care.</ol>
                <ol>How they felt about the transition and the likelihood of changing their lawn based on their own experiences with lawn
                care and yard maintenance (emotions & pain points).</ol></ul>
                <br>
                <p class="researchContent">
                Thus, we started our research on our competitor’s to discover what knowledge is already available and how we can develop our site. </ol>
                </p>

                <h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
            
                <p class="researchContent">
                    We started reviewing educational sites and product sites then evaluating their presentation of information. We
                    conducted a IA heuristic of these sites due to the ample amount of information there is on artificial grass and
                    complexity of presentation along with other features. Our analysis provided us with how we can present and provide
                    our users ease in accessing information and implementing an informed choice laid out on one website.</p>
                    <img src="Kill Your Grass Images/Competitor Analysis copy.jpeg" style="width: 800px; margin-left: 20%;margin-top: 3%;margin-bottom: 3%;">

                    <h5>Proto Persona</h5>

                    <p class="researchContent">
                    After our insight with our research, we needed to preview who Kill Your Grass users would be. We began with sending a
                    survey questionnaire with demographics and general questions about artificial grass and lawn care. The survey results
                    provided us insight on what we needed to start composing our proto persona. This enabled us to understand our users'
                    needs based on their gains and pain points but most importantly why and how our users would seek our site.
                    <img src="Kill Your Grass Images/proto-persona copy.png" style="width: 800px; margin-left: 15.5%;margin-top: 5%;">


                    <h5>User Interviews</h5>
                    <p class="researchContent">
                        With a user in mind, we started our research interview plan with questions developing on each objective. The
                        preliminary survey allowed us to see how our questions can differ and gain a deeper insight to the psychology of our users using
                        open-ended questions while giving us a criteria for who our ideal interviewees are. We recruited five participants to
                        interview to gain an in-depth understanding of our users and confirm our initial comprehension of them from our
                        survey and proto persona. We discover overarching themes which are the following:
                    <ul>
                        <ol>Most users have some knowledge of Artificial grass</ol>
                        <ol>Most users care for yard about 1x a week ( watering varied)</ol>
                        <ol>3:5 said they would get artificial grass</ol>
                        <ol>Time is a common issue</ol>
                        <ol>Cost is the only hesitation about artificial grass</ol>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
    </div>

  <!-- Define & Ideate  -->

        <div class="contentDefSynth">
            <H2> <strong> Define & Ideate </strong></H2>
            <p class="defsynthContent"> We synthesized the data from our survey and interviews to help us start identifying how we
                can resolve the challenges facing our users goal's when it comes to alleviating lawn care expenditures, time and
                energy.</p>

            <h5>Affinity Diagram</h5>

            <p class="defsynthContent">
                We gathered and organized by our insights from our interviews and used an Affinity Diagram to organize our insights.
                These included their demographics and snippets of comments from our interviews. We scoped for common patterns
                between our users and conducted further dissection of notes and sorted them into groups.</p>

            <img src="Kill Your Grass Images/Affinity 2 copy.jpeg" style="width: 900px; margin-left: 20%;margin-top: 3%;margin-bottom: 5%;">
       
            <h5>Empathy Map</h5>
            <p class="defsynthContent">
                After grouping our insights we wanted to gain a deeper understanding of how our user’s empathize with their yard. We
                used an empathy map to distinguish our user’s modes of perception and how they could connect to artificial grass.
            </p>
            <img src="Kill Your Grass Images/Empathy Map copy.jpeg"style="width: 800px; margin-left: 24%;margin-top: 3%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
            <p class="defsynthContent">
                From our deduced data, we discovered the needs for our site to address both pains and gains expressed from our user.
                However, we desired to stay centered on our specific user so we began with composing a user persona.
            </p>
            <br>
           <h5>User Persona</h5>
           <p class="defsynthContent">
            With the insight from our empathy map and affinity diagram, We wanted to ensure we had a focal user as we began to ideate and know who to design for. We created our user persona Ray Jensen. 
        </p>
        <img src="Kill Your Grass Images/Kill Your Grass persona copy.jpeg"style="width: 800px; margin-left: 24%;margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 8%;">
        <p class="defsynthContent">
        Now with a better understanding with who our Kill Your Grass user is, their pains and gains. We 
        gathered our top features and began sketching our wireframes.
    </p>

    <h5>Lo-fi Wireframe Sketches</h5>
    <p class="defsynthContent">
    Our wireframes focused on the main pages our users would interact with.

            <H2> <strong> Prototyping & Testing </strong></H2>
            <p class="protoContent">
                To test the functionality of our app, we conducted usablity testing early into our protoype to ensure we
                could refine our app and iterate our final prototype to be functional and intutive to our users.

            <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
            <p class="protoContent">
                Our usability testing was done remote via Zoom with a moderated Think Aloud method. We recruited five participants
                to test our design’s functionality by stating their thoughts on how they felt, what they saw, and their actions
                while going testing the site by completing tasks given. We formulated tasks based on our main pages which were our
                homepage, resources, gallery and education page. The following feedback we received was to: 
                <ul>
                    <ol>Reduce text and add more white space</ol>
                    <ol>Add a transition or animation to indicate more content on homepage</ol>
                    <ol>Change layout of education pages</ol>
                    <ol>Time is a common issue</ol>

            <h5>Final Prototype</h5>
            <p class="usertestingContent">
                We iterated our prototye three times due to the feedback we recieved. It was vital to ensure our app was
                friendly
                and functional due to the complexitity of our problem. Our solution had to have a clear task flow which
                was refined
                in our second iteration and add a minimalistic design. Our final usuability testing phase reception was
                considered
                great among our users testing and provided additional recommendations to grow Pantry.
